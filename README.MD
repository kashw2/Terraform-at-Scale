**Terraform at Scale** is a project made to provide resources past documentation on how to achieve efficient
and effective regional or global scale using the Azure platform.

It contains some common and not so common examples of scenarios some engineers may find themselves in when needing
to take their organisation or hobby to other regions or to a global scale using examples supported by pure Terraform
with no edge cases requiring management of resources outside of Terraform.
