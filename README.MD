- [**Frontdoor + AKS + Nginx Ingress Controller:**](./azure/frontdoor-aks-nginx) This example demonstrates how Terraform is
  used to facilitate a Frontdoor implementation with Azure Kubernetes Service, and it's Nginx Ingress Controller.
- [**Frontdoor + App Service:**](./azure/frontdoor-app-service) This example demonstrates how Terraform is used to facilitate
  a Frontdoor implementation with Dev, Test and Prod App Service deployments in a multi region scenario (United States
  and Australia).
- [**Frontdoor + Function App:**](./azure/frontdoor-function-app) This example demonstrates how Terraform is used to facilitate
  a Frontdoor implementation with Dev, Test and Prod Function App deployments in a multi region scenario (United States
  and Australia).
- [**Frontdoor + Container App:**](./azure/frontdoor-container-app) This example demonstrates how Terraform is used to
  facilitate a Frontdoor implementation with two Container App deployments in a single region. Its purpose is to
